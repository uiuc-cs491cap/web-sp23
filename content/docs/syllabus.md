## Purpose {#purpose}

The purpose of this course is to prepare you to compete in ICPC-style competitive programming contests.  While this will help
you compete in the Illinois Programming League, Hacker Rank, Code Forces, or similar contests, learning this material has been shown
to help with programming assignments in other courses, and many students learn this material to become confident and skillful in coding
interviews.


## Objectives and Outcomes {#objectives-and-outcomes}

Upon successfully completing this course, you will have solved many programming problems.  You will have learned to select the correct
algorithm depending on the problem constraints and available time and memory resources.  You will have learned to implement your
solutions quickly and accurately, being given minimal guidance if your solution is incorrect.  You will have learned to work on your own
and in an ICPC style team of students using one computer.  And hopefully you will have a lot of fun doing so!


## Class Structure {#class-structure}

This is a flipped classroom.  You will be given a reading from the textbook, a short video to watch, and a sample problem or two to solve before class.
During class the instructor will ask for student comments about the problems and give commentary.   Afterward, there will be one or two more problems
for you to do during class.  Sometimes you will be asked to solve them individually, sometimes you will be placed in a team.  Once every two weeks we
will also release a problem set with a variety of problems to give you practice picking the correct algorithm to use.


## Assignments and Grading {#assignments-and-grading}

This course is a Credit/No Credit course.  To get credit, you must complete 70% of the class-related problems, attend at least 70% of
the class sessions (or have made other arrangements), and complete six of the given bi-weekly
problem sets.  You may also get problem set credit by competing in an ICPC tryout or other significant externally held contest.

We will also have an assignment where you prepare a Team Reference Document.  This assignment is not required, but highly recommended.


## Students with Disabilities {#students-with-disabilities}

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor as soon as
possible. To insure that disability-related concerns are properly
addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require
assistance to participate in this class should contact disability
resources and educational services
([DRES](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/)) and see the instructor
as soon as possible. If you need accommodations for any sort of
disability, please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to
see me, or see me during my office hours. DRES provides students with
academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES
you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (v/tdd), or
e-mail a message to [disability@uiuc.edu](mailto:disability@uiuc.edu).


## Emergency Response Recommendations {#emergency-response-recommendations}

The university police have posted some [emergency response recommendations](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency/). I
encourage you to review this website and the campus building
[floor plans website](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/)
within the first 10 days of class.

Of course, since we're all online, your classroom is likely your living space.  Have you considered making
a fire safety plan with your family or roommates?


## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) {#family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act--ferpa}

Any student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to family
educational rights and privacy act (FERPA) should self-identify to the
instructor to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this
course. see the [FERPA](http://registrar.illinois.edu/ferpa) site for more information.


## Mental Health {#mental-health}

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive
worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can
interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services
including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric
services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or someone
you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly
encouraged to contact or visit any of the University's resources provided below.
Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and for those
who care about you.
