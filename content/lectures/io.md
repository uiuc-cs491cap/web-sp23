The first thing your program needs to do is read in the test data and convert it to an internal structure.
There are several patterns that test cases follow, and you will need to handle each one a bit differently.
It all comes down to knowing how much data you are going to get.  There are three primary ways you find this out:

-   An explicit count
-   A special marker (like a terminating zero)
-   Simply getting an end-of-file

We will also talk about formatting options.

We don't have a video for this lecture, but here are some slides with all the content.
