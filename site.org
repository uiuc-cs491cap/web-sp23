Welcome to Competitive Programming!  In this class you will learn how to compete in programming contests such as ICPC,
Code Forces, and Hacker Rank.  *Is this class for you?  Read on to find out...*

*** What Are the Benefits of Competitive Programming?

Participating in coding contests has benefits!

  You will
  - build confidence in your coding skills,
  - increase your coding speed,
  - be ready to crush a coding interview,
  - and quite possibly make some friends!

*** But... I'm not very competitive, and besides, I'll never beat those top students!

That doesn't matter!  Whether you are just starting out or whether you are competing for a chance at the World Finals,
the only person you're really trying to beat is yourself.  The goal is to try hard, do a little bit better than last time,
or perhaps learn something that will help you next time.  You can do practice problems on your own, but there's nothing
like a contest to keep you honest.

*** Am I ready for this course?

The only prerequisite is that we assume you know how to program.  We don't even assume you're any good at it... this course
will help with that part.  But if you have programmed in Python, C, or C++ then you are ready for this course.

It does help if you've taken data structures and a theory course... but you can get started now and take those later as you
get stronger.

** Getting Started

:END:

*** How Do I Get Started?

  - Join the CampusWire forum.  If you registered before class started, you should have gotten an invite.  If you registered late,
    or did not get the invite, you need to email the instructor.
  - It is recommended that you get these books:
    - [[https://cpbook.net][Competitive Programming 4]].  It is a two book set.
    - [[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-72547-5][Guide to Competitive Programming]].  As of this writing the PDF is free.
  - Register on [[https://codeforces.com][Code Forces]].  Your username *will be visible* to other students; you can create a "throwaway"
    account if you want just for this course.
    - Once you are registered, join [[https://codeforces.com/group/C1FCILxvRp/contests][the class group]].  This is where your problems
      will be hosted.
  - Also register on https://vjudge.net
    - THe class group is at https://vjudge.net/group/uiuc-cs491-sp23

*** How do I get good at this?

Practice.  A lot.  But do it efficiently...

  - Attend contests as much as you can.
    - [[https://codeforces.com][Code Forces]] has two hour long contests usually once or twice a week, for instance.
    - After the contest is over, read the commentary, both for the problems you solved, and the problems you attempted and could not solve.
    - Upsolve the ones you couldn't do.  (I don't know why they call it upsolving.)  This means that you go back to the computer, finish
      your solution, and submit it until you get it accepted.
  - Solve practice problems
    - This has a similar feel, but in this case it's okay get help.  If you are solving UVa problems you can use the UDebug and UHunt
      sites for extra hints / sample inputs.

*** Purpose

The purpose of this course is to prepare you to compete in ICPC-style competitive programming contests.  While this will help
you compete in the Illinois Programming League, Hacker Rank, Code Forces, or similar contests, learning this material has been shown
to help with programming assignments in other courses, and many students learn this material to become confident and skillful in coding
interviews.

*** Objectives and Outcomes

Upon successfully completing this course, you will have solved many programming problems.  You will have learned to select the correct
algorithm depending on the problem constraints and available time and memory resources.  You will have learned to implement your
solutions quickly and accurately, being given minimal guidance if your solution is incorrect.  You will have learned to work on your own
and in an ICPC style team of students using one computer.  And hopefully you will have a lot of fun doing so!

*** Class Structure

This is a flipped classroom.  You will be given a reading from the textbook, a short video to watch, and a sample problem or two to solve before class.
During class the instructor will ask for student comments about the problems and give commentary.   Afterward, there will be one or two more problems
for you to do during class.  Sometimes you will be asked to solve them individually, sometimes you will be placed in a team.  Once every two weeks we
will also release a problem set with a variety of problems to give you practice picking the correct algorithm to use.

*** Assignments and Grading

This course is a Credit/No Credit course.  To get credit, you must complete 70% of the class-related problems, attend at least 70% of
the class sessions (or have made other arrangements), and complete six of the given bi-weekly
problem sets.  You may also get problem set credit by competing in an ICPC tryout or other significant externally held contest.

We will also have an assignment where you prepare a Team Reference Document.  This assignment is not required, but highly recommended.

*** Students with Disabilities

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor as soon as
possible. To insure that disability-related concerns are properly
addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require
assistance to participate in this class should contact disability
resources and educational services
([[https://www.disability.illinois.edu/)][DRES]] and see the instructor
as soon as possible. If you need accommodations for any sort of
disability, please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to
see me, or see me during my office hours. DRES provides students with
academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES
you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (v/tdd), or
e-mail a message to [[mailto:disability@uiuc.edu][disability@uiuc.edu]].

*** Emergency Response Recommendations

The university police have posted some [[http://police.illinois.edu/emergency/][emergency response recommendations]]. I
encourage you to review this website and the campus building
[[http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/][floor plans website]]
within the first 10 days of class.

Of course, since we're all online, your classroom is likely your living space.  Have you considered making
a fire safety plan with your family or roommates?

*** Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)


Any student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to family
educational rights and privacy act (FERPA) should self-identify to the
instructor to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this
course. see the [[http://registrar.illinois.edu/ferpa][FERPA]] site for more information.

*** Mental Health

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive
worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can
interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services
including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric
services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or someone
you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly
encouraged to contact or visit any of the University's resources provided below.
Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and for those
who care about you.

The first thing your program needs to do is read in the test data and convert it to an internal structure.
There are several patterns that test cases follow, and you will need to handle each one a bit differently.
It all comes down to knowing how much data you are going to get.  There are three primary ways you find this out:

- An explicit count
- A special marker (like a terminating zero)
- Simply getting an end-of-file

We will also talk about formatting options.

We don't have a video for this lecture, but here are some slides with all the content.

*** Slides

** Standard Template Library

Today we will discuss the standard template library for C++.  You don't have to use this for your own
programming, but we will use it in our examples so you should know how it all works.

Also knowns as "brute force"; this paradigm happens when there's nothing to do but check all the possible solutions.

BUT!!!  That doesn't mean that you can't be clever how you do it.
